# Alientek DP100 experiments

The goal is to make a useful library

Currently only able to send a frame and get something back

I am using these sources for support:

* https://github.com/ElluIFX/DP100-PyQt5-GUI (python, but really just calls into the DLLs)
* https://github.com/lessu/open_dp100 (rust)
* https://github.com/scottbez1/webdp100 (typescript)
